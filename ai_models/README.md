# 🧠 Object Detection Duo — Doors & Money with YOLOv8

Welcome to the **Object Detection Duo** — two compact, real-world YOLOv8 models trained to detect **doors** and **paper money** with speed and precision. These models are built for **accessibility**, and are being used in an AI-powered app designed to help **visually impaired people** navigate and recognize their environment more independently.

## 📱 What's the Big Idea?

This project is part of a larger initiative to build a **mobile-friendly AI app** that assists visually impaired users in:

- 🔓 Finding doors in unfamiliar spaces  
- 💵 Identifying paper currency quickly and accurately  

The models here are optimized for **real-time use** on smartphones and low-power devices — no coins, no clutter, just smart detection where it matters most.

🧩 You’ll find the **code for the app itself in the parent directory**, so feel free to explore how everything ties together!

## 📂 What's Inside This Directory?

This directory contains two sub-projects, each with its own dataset, training pipeline, and exported models:

- 🚪 [`door-detection/`](./door-detection/) — YOLOv8 model trained to detect doors in indoor and outdoor scenes  
- 💵 [`money-detection/`](./money-detection/) — YOLOv8 model trained specifically for recognizing paper money (no coins)

Each folder includes:

- 📈 Training results & metrics  
- 📸 Inference examples  
- 🧠 Jupyter notebooks for training and conversion  
- 📦 Exported models in multiple formats (PyTorch, TFLite, Web)

For full details, check the README inside each subfolder.
